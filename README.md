# Graph-Library
A Graph data structure library with many functions implemented in C++ using OOPS concepts

An abstract base class Graph is used to model a graph. The derived classes DirectedGraph and UndirectedGraph inherit from class Graph.

Currently added features:


Create a Graph with N vertices.

Add an unweighted edge between two vertices u,v.

Add a weighted edge between two vertices u,v.

Traverse the Graph using BFS or DFS.

Check if the Graph is cyclic.
